Minecraft username: Cysero45

I was banned on: 1/06/2019 (NZL)

I was banned by: The server itself

I was banned for: Like, a fair enough reason. I said the n word

A brief summary of what happened before the ban was: We were discussing the chat filters such as wither (child)
and wb (random sentences). Some one said vulgarity was allowed but not racist comments. I said "like nigger?" and I was banned immediately.

I like to be unbanned because: I like minecraft man and I'm bored, I'm a pretty decent guy and I have learned my lesson about these matters

I often slap little kids because: They deserve it... and for fun
